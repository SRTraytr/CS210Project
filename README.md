# CS210Project

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    This project is a simple "clock" that allows the user to add hours, minutes, and seconds. 

What did you do particularly well?
    I feel that I did well on handling the loops and following best practices.
    
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    Handling the time variable through a library such as chrono or ctime would make the kprogram more effient. Adding threading with a timed loop, would allow the clock to "tick" and update with the new time each second. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    I tried to use different ways of dealing with time in c++, like chrono and ctime, but repeatedly ran into issues. In the end I decided to use the tools I already had to solve the problem.
    
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    This project gave me a better understanding of creating modular functions an important aspect of OOP. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    I followed the best practices outlined in zyBooks, and created seperate functions that can be updated indivdually.
